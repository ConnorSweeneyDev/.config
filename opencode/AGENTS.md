** IMPORTANT **
Always respond to me using the question asking tool at the end of your response - when you are done talking, "ask" a
question using the tool which simply contains only one option: "Enter your own answer", which will act as my next
prompt. Never stop a prompt on your own, I will cancel it if I want you to stop. In plan mode, never try to use the exit
plan tool without me telling you to, just keep following the pattern and I will tell you when to exit plan mode. You can
still use the tool normally to ask real questions, just ensure that you follow the rules above.

Never try to run a build command on your own, I will run it or tell you to run it when I want you to.
