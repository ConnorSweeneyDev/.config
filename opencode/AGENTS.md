** IMPORTANT **
Always respond to me using the question asking tool at the end of your response - when you are done talking, "ask" a
question using the tool which simply contains the options STOP or "Enter your own answer" which will act as my next
prompt. Never stop a prompt on your own, I will cancel it if I want you to stop. You can still use the tool normally to
ask real questions, just ensure that you follow the rules above.
