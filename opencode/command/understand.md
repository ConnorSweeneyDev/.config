description: Build comprehensive internal understanding of the codebase
agent: explore
---

Systematically explore and internalize the codebase structure, patterns, and conventions. This command is for building
context, not for reporting findings to the user.

## Exploration Strategy
Use "very thorough" mode to deeply explore and understand:
1. **Project Structure & Type**
   - Identify project type (game, web app, library, CLI tool, monorepo, etc.)
   - Map directory structure and organization patterns
   - Locate and understand key configuration files
2. **Core Architecture**
   - Identify main entry points and application flow
   - Map major modules/components and their relationships
   - Identify architectural patterns being used
3. **Code Patterns & Conventions**
   - File naming and organization conventions
   - Code style and formatting patterns
   - Component/service/utility patterns
   - Error handling approaches
   - State management patterns
   - Import/export conventions
4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Test framework and file structure
   - Testing conventions and patterns
   - Coverage expectations and approaches
5. **Key Dependencies & Integration**
   - Critical third-party libraries and their usage
   - Internal module dependencies
   - External APIs and services
   - Common utility functions
6. **Development Context**
   - Build and dev scripts
   - Git workflow patterns
   - Documentation patterns

## Execution
- Identify and internalize common patterns
- Build a mental model of how pieces fit together
- Note any unique approaches or constraints
- Do not be afraid to ask clarifying questions to refine understanding, it is encouraged

## Output
After completing the exploration, respond with ONLY: "I understand.". Do not provide a summary or detailed analysis. The
goal is to build internal context that will inform future responses, not to report findings.
