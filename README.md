# WorkflowForWindows11

All my Neovim config files (using packer), along with fzf for PowerShell commands and shortcuts.
I will list dependencies when I have to set everything up from scratch again, but pretty much everything is installed using winget, pip, packer or coc.

Full paths are as follows:
- nvim -> C:\Users\conno\AppData\Local\nvim
- which -> C:\which
- PowerShell -> C:\Users\conno\Documents\PowerShell

These aren't in the repository but are valuable to have:
- MinGW -> C:\MinGW (https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/)
- Dependencies -> C:\Dependency Walker (https://github.com/lucasg/Dependencies)
