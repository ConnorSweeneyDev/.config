# WorkflowForWindows11

All my NeoVim config files (using packer), along with fzf for PowerShell commands and shortcuts.
I will list dependencies when I have to set everything up from scratch again, but pretty much everything is installed using winget.

Full paths are as follows:

- nvim -> C:\Users\conno\AppData\Local\nvim
- which -> C:\which
- PowerShell -> C:\Users\conno\Documents\PowerShell
